# Getting Started

To run the app, you must generate your own [API key](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once it's done, you can either pass the key while starting the app, e.g.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your_key> yarn start
```

... or alternatively, you can create own `.env` file with following content:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your_key>
```
